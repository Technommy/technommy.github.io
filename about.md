	As an ambitious teenager, I'm really curious about everything like other young boys. Actually, there are two type of things I'm passionate about, one is programming, which I've contributed some codes and specs translation in few open source projects and web standards. And the other is visual art, well, I'm now mainly working on graphic designing like Typography and User Interface, you can find some of my works on this website :-) Also, as an community activist, I founded the Adolescent Developer Community last year, now I’m an intern at Opera Software China during my gap year to college.
