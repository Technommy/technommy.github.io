	As an ambitious teenager, I'm really curious about everything like other young boy. Actually, there are two type of things I'm passioned about, one is programming, which I've contributed some codes and specs translation in few open source project and web standards. And the other is visual arts, well, I'm now mainly working on graphic designing like Typography and User Interface, you can find some of my work in this website :-) Also, as an community activist, I founded the Adolescent Developer Community last year, now I’m an intern at Opera Software China during my gap year to college.
